      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        By using Clean Foods, you agree to the following terms governing our
        bulk supply services.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Bulk Orders & MOQs</h3>
      <p>
        Most products have a Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ). Prices are subject to
        market fluctuations but are locked in once your bank transfer receipt is
        uploaded and verified.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Payment Verification</h3>
      <p>
        Orders are only processed after bank transfer verification. Please
        ensure the uploaded receipt is clear and matches the total order value.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Returns & Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the perishable nature of food items, returns are only accepted if
        the goods do not match the quality described (e.g., presence of stones)
        or if there is visible damage upon delivery.
      </p>
